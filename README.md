# Analysis on Global Terrorism Dataset
In this project , we have worked on a dataset known as 'Global Terrorism'. We have gathered the data from a site known as 'START'(Study of Terrorism And Responses to Terrorism). Initially , on this dataset we have performed various operations like data cleaning and preprocessing , exploratory data analysis, outliers detection, etc. After performing these operations, we have considered only the Top-3 Targets areas which were mostly attacked by the perpetrators. For classifing and predicting the type of attack, we have used several machine-learning algorithms like Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbours, etc. After performing such algorithms, we are able to predict the type or class of the attack which will happen in the future. The fundamental motive of this project is to predict the correct type of the attack with maximum accuracy and then take respective security and safety measures based on that.
