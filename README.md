# Analysis on Global Terrorism Dataset
We select top 3 areas (like military base, public sector, police station) which were affected the most by terrorist attack  and did analysis on it. Motive of our analysis is to provide security to particular areas which were targeted by terrorist groups.We check that our prediction is right or not by testing on Real-Time data.
